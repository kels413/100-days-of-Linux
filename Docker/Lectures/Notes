#Lecture on Docker

What is Container ??

A container is way to package an application with all the necessary configurations and
dependcies that the project we are trying to build needs.


Container's are portable, so we can share them around

where do containers live ??

A container repositories
private Repositories

Let's look into what Docker and vm tries to solve for us.

so basically Docker and vms mainly helps us in virtualization in our computer.

Now the os is mainly divided into two which are.

The Applications layer
the os kernel layer


what is the Application layer ??

the application layer is the top most part of the os, that provides a means
in which the user can communicate with the os kernel to perform specific instructions

what is the os kernel ??

the os kernel is an important software in our kernel whose main work is to communicate with the hardware in order to manage resources in our computer,such as sharing cpu, scheduling process and alot more, and its more closer to the hardware of the computer.

now how do containers and vms(virtual Machine manages virtualizes our computer) ??

let's first of all look at how vm's virtualizes, Vms virtualizes the Application layer of the os and the os kernel or kernel in short


that means a vm comes with it's own operating system kernel and application layer, they only share the computers hardware.

while a contianer only virtualizes the Application layer of the os, and shares the os kernel and computers hardware.


Difference between Images and Container.
